            Thanks to Flatpak, Snap and Appimage, the user can always have the
            latest version of the applications they use, without having to wait
            for the next release of Vanilla OS.

            Vanilla OS uses an A/B structure (<a href="#">ABRoot</a>), which
            transacts updates atomically between two root micro partitions. The
            benefits of this system are the guarantee that the system is altered
            only when the entire transaction is successful (concept of
            atomicity), furthermore, the double root partition structure allows
            you to roll back to the previous state, directly from your boot, you
            will always have a home to come back to.
          </p>
          <p class="text-xl lg:text-2xl">
            This structure, unlike others, is compatible with already existing
            distributions and does not require a complex setup and allows easy
            re-initialization of the system without data loss.
